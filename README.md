# Data-Science-Practice
Some Few Practices from My Learning Data Science Journey:

1 - Analyze Sales Data : analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data.

2 - Housing Price Prediction : This data science project, as my first data mining course's project during my PhD program, demonstrates a step-by-step process for creating a model that predicts real estate prices. Initially,     we will construct a model using sklearn and linear regression,
    utilizing the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle.com. The second step involves developing other machin learning algorithms to predict the price and then define a function to investigate which of these algorithms      with different hyperparameter predict the price more accuratly.
    Throughout the model-building process, we will cover various data science concepts, including data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter           tuning using grid search cross-validation, and more.

3 - Movie Dataset Creation: I scrape Wikipedia pages to create a dataset on Disney movies. In this project, I used a wide range of Python & data science topics including, web scraping with BeautifulSoup, cleaning data,          testing code with Pytest, pattern matching with regular expressions (Re library), working with dates (datetime library) and saving & loading data with Pickle library.
    
4 - PCA-Learning : a practice of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in some unsupervised machine learning algorithms 

5 - Survival-of-Titanic : The most common data science project in the world :) A participate in Kaggle Competition and just for having in my record!

6 - XGBoost-Learning : Exploring different machine learning algorithms in terms of their accuracy and runtime.
